Here, look for available food, mark a post as gone, or thank an OP for sharing. On the second tab, add a post to the food feed by typing in a food item and location and clicking post. On the third tab, view your name, username, and number of thanks that you've recieved from other users on your posts. To change your name, username, or password, go the settings page by clicking settings from the profile tab. To view or delete any of your own posts, click your posts from the profile tab.
