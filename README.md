# Food Finder

This is a mobile application for finding free, leftover food on the campus of Colorado College. It is the senior capstone project of Laura Himelman and Chris Klusendorf.

## Install

1. On a mobile device, download the Ionic View app from the App Store or Google Play Store.
2. Navigate to the middle tab where there is a code entry box.
3. Enter the code 94b20da7.
4. Once the code is entered, the Food Finder app should appear under “All Apps.” Tap on the Food Finder app, and it will take you to the home page.
5. From there, all implemented app functionality will work, and you can proceed as you wish.
5. To exit the app, shake the device. This will bring up a control menu with the options to exit the app or cancel the action and stay in the app.

## Demo

Once the app loads, click register to sign up for a new account. The app will login to the food feed tab where posts about food can be interacted with. Here, look for available food, mark a post as gone, or thank an OP for sharing. On the second tab, add a post to the food feed by typing in a food item and location and clicking post. On the third tab, view your name, username, and number of thanks that you've received from other users on your posts. To change your name, username, or password, go the settings page by clicking settings from the profile tab. To view or delete any of your own posts, click your posts from the profile tab.
